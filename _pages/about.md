Hi, I am Shibo Hao, a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>, <a href='https://datascience.ucsd.edu/'>Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)</a>. My advisor is Professor <a href='http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/'>Zhiting Hu</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. My research interests lie in neuro-symbolic reasoning and its applications in NLP. My goal is to develop principled methods that make LMs more capable, robust, and interpretable.
