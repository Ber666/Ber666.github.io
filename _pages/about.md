Hi, I am Shibo Hao, a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>, <a href='https://datascience.ucsd.edu/'>Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)</a>. My advisor is Professor <a href='http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/'>Zhiting Hu</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. 

I aim to design principled methods to enhance the reasoning ability of foundation models (especially LLMs). This includes building a system-2 reasoning framework with a world model (<a href="https://world-model.maitrix.org/">Pandora</a>) and a search algorithm for planning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992">Reasoning via planning</a>). I'm also interested in new training methods (<a href="https://yu-fangxu.github.io/FoR.github.io/">Flow of Reasoning</a>) and augmenting LLMs with external tools (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11554">ToolkenGPT</a>). We are maintaining a library ( <a href="https://www.llm-reasoners.net/">LLM Reasoners</a>) for reasoning algorithms in a unified formulation. My research goal is to create intelligent systems based on foundation models, which will possess the ability to perceive, take actions, and learn from the environments like human.
