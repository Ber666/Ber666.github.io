Hi, I am Shibo Hao, a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>, <a href='https://datascience.ucsd.edu/'>Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)</a>. My advisor is Professor <a href='http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/'>Zhiting Hu</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. 
My research interest lies in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, I aim to design principled methods to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992">Reasoning-via-planning</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ber666/llm-reasoners/">LLM Reasoners</a>), augment LLMs with external tools (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11554">ToolkenGPT</a>), and interpret the knowledge of language models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14268">BertNet</a>). Looking forward, my goal is to create general autonomous agents based on foundation models, which will possess the ability to perceive, take actions, and learn from their embodied environments.
